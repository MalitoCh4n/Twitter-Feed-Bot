This is a powerful twitter bot for discord. It allows you to follow up to 5000 Twitter users, track 400 words and 25 location boxes posting the content to as many Discord channels as you want. Furthermore you can customize which tweets to show

# Configuration

If you are using Heroku you already have a running bot. However it only supports a single Twitter feed 
The configuration is written very extensively explaining what each variable does. There are 2 ways to configure the bot. Either through [config.yml] or through the use of [environment variables]
